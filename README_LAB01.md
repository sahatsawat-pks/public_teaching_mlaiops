# ITCS355 Lab 1 — Reproducible Training

Predicting machine failure within 7 days from sensor readings. The model is not the point;
whether a stranger can reproduce it is.

> **This README is graded.** A grader with Docker and nothing else from your setup runs one
> command and compares the result against the claim below. Edit every `<...>` and delete the

## Reproduce

```bash
make reproduce
```

expected test_roc_auc: 0.8480 ± 0.0100

Runtime: about 40 seconds on 4 cores. No cloud account or credentials needed for this command —
that is deliberate, and it is why a grader can run it.

## The problem

240 machines, 25 readings each, 6 sensor features, binary target `failed_within_7d` with a
positive rate near 12%.

Machines have persistent characteristics — a hot-running machine reads hot in every row. So the
train/validation/test split is **grouped by `machine_id`**: every reading from one machine lands
in exactly one partition. Splitting row-wise instead lets the model memorise the machine and
reports a validation score that will never survive production. `tests/test_data.py` asserts this
property holds, and Lab 4 turns it into a CI gate.

Bringing your own dataset is allowed. Replace `scripts/make_dataset.py`, update the schema in
`src/data.py`, and keep every test passing.

---

## Layout

```
src/          Layer 1 — provider-neutral. No SDKs, no bucket names, no absolute paths.
cloudlayer/   Layer 3 — the only place a provider SDK may be imported.
scripts/      Dataset generation, cloud check, portability audit, metric verification.
tests/        Data contract tests and split property tests.
```

`src/config.py` is the single point of environment knowledge. Everything else reads from it.
`make portability-audit` enforces the rule; it fails the build if a provider string appears in
`src/` or `tests/`.

---

## Setup

```bash
cp cloud.env.example cloud.env      # fill in, never commit
make setup
make cloud-check                    # eight slots, all PASS
make data                           # generate the dataset
make test                           # 10 tests, all passing
```

Post your `make cloud-check` output in the course channel before Session 1.

## What was completed

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `requirements.txt` | Regenerated with `pip-compile --generate-hashes` |
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build pinned by digest to `linux/amd64`; added `--require-hashes` |
| `cloudlayer/gcp.py` | Implemented `upload`, `download`, `push_image` returning digest reference |
| This README | Completed reproducibility trade-off question and grader documentation |

## Reproducibility trade-off

Under real time pressure, I would drop **controlled seeds** first. 

Dropping seeds breaks exact numerical determinism—training metrics will fluctuate across runs within an expected statistical variance, causing point-in-time assertion checks to fail without a tolerance margin. 

However, the pipeline remains functionally reproducible: it builds, installs, and executes predictably. In contrast, dropping dependency hashes or digest-pinned base images risks silent upstream drift, ABI mismatches, or supply-chain tampering that cause fatal build or runtime failures. Managing statistical variance is acceptable; an unbuildable container is not.

## Notes for the grader

- **Platform & Digest Pinning**: The training container image is built with a multi-stage `Dockerfile` pinned by SHA256 digest (`python@sha256:...`) and compiled for `linux/amd64` to guarantee identical behavior across Apple Silicon and x86 CI/grading runners.
- **Group-Aware Splitting**: `src/data.py` partitions by `machine_id` so that all readings for any machine reside strictly within one partition (train, validation, or test). Disjointness is verified in `tests/test_data.py`.
- **Cloud Layer**: The provider adapter (`cloudlayer/gcp.py`) uses Google Cloud Storage for blob upload/download and Artifact Registry for digest-pinned container pushes. No provider strings or SDKs exist in `src/` or `tests/` (`make portability-audit` clean).
- **Run Tracking**: MLflow logs all hyperparameters, seeds, validation/test metrics, DVC data version hashes, git commit SHAs, and model artifacts.

## Checklist before you submit

- [x] `make reproduce` works from a fresh clone, on a machine that is not yours
- [x] `make verify` passes against your claim line
- [x] `make test` — all tests pass
- [x] `make portability-audit` — clean
- [x] Image builds for `linux/amd64` and is pushed, digest-pinned
- [x] `dvc push` completed; a grader can `dvc pull`
- [x] Five or more tracked runs with params, metrics, data fingerprint, and commit SHA
- [x] Every **REPLACE** block above is gone (the course-materials block at the top stays)
- [x] `git log -p | grep -i -E "secret|password|AKIA|BEGIN PRIVATE"` returns nothing

That last check is not optional. A credential in Git history is an automatic deduction in this
course, and rotating it is your responsibility, not the grader's.
